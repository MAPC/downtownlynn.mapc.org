      <p class="InlineHeadings">Support efforts to  make Downtown an arts, culture, and dining destination:</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">1. Support  Downtown Lynn Cultural District&rsquo;s efforts</span> to showcase Lynn&rsquo;s art and culture  assets and cultivate a lively image and brand for Downtown Lynn. Continue to  complement DTLCD&rsquo;s initiatives with strategic real estate and infrastructure investments.</p>
      <p><span style="margin-bottom:5px"><span class="InlineHeadings">More on the DTLCD brand: </span>In December 2011, consultant <a href="http://marthaalmy.com" target="_blank">Martha Almy</a> delivered the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DTLCD/downtown-lynn-cultural-district-brand-presentation" target="_blank">presentation</a> shown on the right regarding branding the Lynn arts and culture district. It was following this presentation that stakeholders voted to re-name the district the Downtown Lynn Arts and Culture District, or DTLCD. This presentation addresses considerations for DTLCD as it moves forward with marketing efforts.</span> Learn more about this effort on by visiting the <a href="http://dtl.mapc.org/What_We_Learned/Downtown_Planning.html#DTLCD_Branding_2011" target="_blank">Downtown Planning</a> page on this website, and visit <a href="http://dtlcd.org/" target="_blank">DTLCD.org</a> for the latest on what the district has to offer.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">2. Regularly  convene artists and arts and cultural organizations to identify challenges they  may be facing.</span> Address challenges as a way of encouraging these individuals and  organizations to remain in Downtown Lynn, and to make Downtown more regionally  attractive to creative industries.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">3. Establish  and/or maintain relationships and regular communication with state agencies and offices</span> including the Executive  Office of Housing and Economic Development&rsquo;s Creative Industries Director, the  Massachusetts Cultural Council, the Massachusetts Office of Travel and Tourism,  and other related state agencies and offices. </p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">4. Establish  and/or maintain relationships and regular communications with regional private  sector marketing and visitor services organizations</span> such as convention and visitors&rsquo;  bureaus and chambers of commerce.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">5. Establish  a wayfinding program</span> (or support DTLCD to do so) to help visitors explore the  variety of amenities Downtown has to offer.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">6. Embrace  public art programs</span>, continuing to support efforts by organizations such as  Centerboard and RAW to create murals or support other artwork in Downtown.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">7. Support  existing and future opportunities to activate public spaces</span> such as farmers&rsquo;  markets, community gardens, outdoor theater and concerts, art walks, and other  activities that bring foot traffic to Downtown and create a buzz.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Already happening in Downtown Lynn:</span> The Lynn Central Square Farmers Market runs on Thursdays from June-October. The market is operated by <a href="http://thefoodproject.org/" target="_blank">The Food Project</a>, an organization that engages <a href="http://thefoodproject.org/what-we-do" target="_blank">&quot;young people in personal and social change through sustainable agriculture.&quot;</a> Food sold at the Farmers Market comes from Food Project <a href="http://thefoodproject.org/our-farms" target="_blank">farms</a> in Lynn and Beverly, which are farmed by teenagers and adult volunteers. Also, <a href="http://www.artsafterhours.com/" target="_blank">Arts After Hours</a> has hosted indoor as well as outdoor theater productions, concerts, and social events in Downtown Lynn, and the <a href="http://dtlna.org/" target="_blank">Downtown Lynn Neighborhood Association</a> has hosted <a href="http://dtlna.org/?p=223" target="_blank">openDTL</a> since 2012, along with many other social events in the neighborhood.

      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">8. Market Downtown Lynn</span> broadly to Greater Boston and beyond, but also target marketing efforts locally to better establish Downtown Lynn as a hub for Lynners and the gateway to the North Shore.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">9. Pursue more cross-marketing opportunities with the  Essex Coastal Scenic Byway</span>, a <a href="http://www.essexheritage.org/aboutbyway" target="_blank">90-mile heritage tourism  route </a>that starts in Lynn and travels northward along the Essex County coastline.
