	  <p class="InlineHeadings">Give Downtown Lynn a more welcoming appearance and reduce physical barriers to enjoying its amenities:</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">1. Continue  façade improvement programs</span> to address exterior property conditions. Update  these programs when new design guidelines or other policies are established. The Lynn Department of Community Development has a <a href="http://www.cityoflynnoecd.net/projects_facade.shtml" target="_blank">Commercial Façade Program</a> which has resulted in storefront improvements to more than twenty downtown businesses. This program should continue to be funded, which will likely require the City to establish new funding sources. Such a program could likely be managed through a Business Improvement District or Main Street program, as described in the recommendations for <a href="/Our_Recommendations/Business_Vitality.html">Business Vitality</a>. Curb appeal matters, and storefronts should appear inviting.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">2. Work  with retailers and other storefront businesses to reduce clutter and improve  visual merchandising</span> of their products, to make their business inviting from  the outside as well as appealing when potential customers enter the business. Again, these ideas can be explored in tandem with other <a href="/Our_Recommendations/Business_Vitality.html">Business Vitality</a> recommendations. Many Massachusetts municipalities have participated in the Best Retail Practices Program offered by<a href="http://retailvisioning.com/" target="_blank"> Retail Visioning</a>.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">3. Remove  architectural barriers to enhance accessibility</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">4. Encourage  property investors and developers to adhere to design guidelines</span>, and encourage  existing property owners to update their properties accordingly.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">5. Advocate  for the establishment of coordinated street cleaning and other services</span> that  could be offered through a BID or special services district.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">6. To  promote a more pleasant atmosphere for walking and dining,</span> eliminate garish  flood lighting throughout Downtown.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">7. Reduce  surface parking lots, </span>not only for municipal lots but private lots as well, as  much of the land in Downtown Lynn is underutilized and there is a surplus of  parking. Encourage shared parking agreements such as Blue Ox restaurant&rsquo;s  agreement with Eastern Bank. In place of pavement, add park space (depending on  extent of contamination issues, if any) or infill development. Pursue a  progressive parking management and pricing strategy. </p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">8. Improve  traffic circulation and make Downtown more pedestrian and bicycle-friendly.</span> Revisit  previous plans such as the 2005 Downtown Traffic Study, 2008 Washington Street  Gateway District Plan, and 2009 Downtown Market Street Vision Plan, which  evaluate changing some one-way streets into two-way streets, offer  recommendations for signage, and provide recommendations for widening  sidewalks, adding bicycle amenities, and improving overall urban design. Pursue  improvements in conjunction with implementing a progressive parking strategy.</p></td>
