    <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Strengthen existing businesses  and attract new ones to encourage downtown development activity and progress: </span>Improving the outlook for individual businesses in Downtown along with improving the vitality of the entire district were among the top concerns of <a href="/Who_We_Met/Community_Engagement.html">community members MAPC met with</a> and has been a key focus of <a href="/What_We_Learned/Downtown_Planning.html">recent economic development studies</a> and <a href="/What_We_Learned/Investments.html">investment efforts</a>. Our recommendations to improve business vitality are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create  a business/permitting guide</li>
      <li> Host  an economic development summit</li>
      <li> Establish  a Business Improvement District or Main Street organization</li>
      <li> Evaluate the role a certified  community development corporation (CDC) could play in Lynn</li>
      <li> Connect  with the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development (EOHED) for state resources, training,  collaboration, and networking opportunities.</li>
      <li>Cultivate  a positive image for Downtown Lynn by developing a marketing plan.</li>
      <li>Work collaboratively with property owners, local banks, and public agencies to address property upkeep, turnover, and modernization across the district.</li>
      <li>Build relationships with Downtown Lynn business owners.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>These recommendations, along with examples from other communities, are described in more detail below.</p>
    <p><span class="InlineHeadings">1. Create  a business/permitting guide</span> and disseminate widely to existing and prospective businesses. Producing a guide like the example shown on this page can help to improve relationships with the business community by making it easier to understand what an entrepreneur needs to do in order to start a business in Lynn. The process of creating the guide can also help the City articulate local procedures and may result in some streamlining of these procedures in order to produce an easy-to-follow guide.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Example: </span>The<a href="http://www.dedham-ma.gov/index.cfm?pid=22428" target="_blank"> Town of Dedham</a> worked with the <a href="http://www.cecilgroup.com/community-planning/dedham-business-permitting-guide/" target="_blank">Cecil Group</a> to design the user-friendly <a href="http://www.dedham-ma.gov/dedham/file/Economic%20Development/Dedham%20Business%20Guide%20Single%20Sided%20Printing.pdf" target="_blank">Dedham Business Guide</a> &quot;to assist small business owners/entrepreneurs in navigating the local permitting process and to be a resource guide to doing business in the Town of Dedham.&quot; This guide won a <a href="ww.apa-ma.org/4123" target="_blank">Planning Project Award</a> from the American Planning Association Massachusetts Chapter (APA-MA) in 2013. The Town makes this guide widely available, and municipal staff pair use of this guide with in-person meetings with prospective business owners.</p>
      <p>Printed guides include a pocket folder with the striking cover photo shown here and a selection of the following  pages, depending on what the business owner needs for their business: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting Started</li>
        <li>People to Know in Dedham</li>
        <li>Overall Process</li>
        <li>Dedham Town Offices and Staff</li>
        <li>Small Business Resources and Links</li>
        <li>Dedham Town Boards and Commissions</li>
        <li>Building Permit</li>
        <li>Opening a New Restaurant in Dedham</li>
        <li>Alcoholic Beverage License</li>
        <li>Opening a Small Retail Store in Dedham</li>
        <li>Business Certificate</li>
        <li>Design Review</li>
        <li>Establishment License</li>
        <li>Site Plan Review</li>
        <li>Special Permit</li>
        <li>Variance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.dedham-ma.gov/dedham/file/Economic%20Development/Dedham%20Business%20Guide%20Single%20Sided%20Printing.pdf" target="_blank">guide available online</a> only includes a few of the pages listed above, and other pages may be made available upon request from the <a href="http://www.dedham-ma.gov/index.cfm?pid=14667" target="_blank">Town of Dedham Economic Development Department</a>.</p>
   

	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">2. Host  an economic development summit</span> and invite developers and employers from across  the country as well as from the region. The summit could cover opportunities  throughout the city, or it could be limited to the Downtown and the Waterfront,  or specifically for Downtown. Involve MAPC, the US Economic Development Administration,  the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development, and Mass Development  in this effort. </p>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Example: </span>In October 2012, the City of Revere hosted an all-day Economic Development Summit, which included:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Presentations  on development opportunities and incentives from City staff, on state level expedited permitting from the State Permit Ombudsman, and on state level financial assistance from the Massachusetts Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development, and MassDevelopment's First Vice President of Finance</li>
	    <li>Speeches by  elected officials including a Congressman, the Massachusetts Speaker of the House, a State Senator, and a State Representative</li>
	    <li>A speech on working with the City from the COO of Suffolk Downs</li>
	    <li>Video presentations from the Mayor and Economic Development Director showcasing Revere's assets, municipal partners, and development opportunities (shown on this page)</li>
	    <li>A guided bus tour of key development sites</li>
	    <li>A networking lunch</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>The City provided every participant with printed materials from the presentations, as well as flash drive with digital copies of the presentation materials as well as the videos. They spent a lot of time thinking about a coordinated message, brand and slogan to promote development in Revere, and many hours reaching out to developers from across the country as well as to regional stakeholders including organizations and companies like MAPC and ZipCar. The event helped strengthen Revere's relationships with private sector and regional entities, forged new partnerships, and resulted in new development activity.</p>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">3. Establish  a Business Improvement District or Main Street organization</span> to coordinate and brand businesses as  well as to offer mutually-beneficial services such as beautification, events,  marketing, and safety initiatives. Such an  organization would likely be separate from the City, but it would work closely  with City as well as the Downtown Lynn Cultural District, the Downtown Lynn Neighborhood  Association,  and other entities.	  </p>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Business Improvement District:</span> Business Improvement Districts (BID) in Massachusetts are &quot;special assessment districts in which property owners vote to initiate, manage, and finance supplemental services or enhancements above and beyond the baseline of services already provided by their local city or town governments&quot; (<a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/community/planning/bid.html" target="_blank">Massachusetts EOHED page on BIDs</a>). Communities can establish a BID under <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleVII/Chapter40O" target="_blank">M.G.L. Chapter 40 O</a>, which requires that a BID be &quot;a contiguous geographic area in which at least 75% of the land is zoned or used for commercial, retail, industrial, or mixed uses&quot; (EOHED). The BID is established through a local petition and public hearing process, in which at property owners of at least 60% of real property and representing at least 51% of the assessed valuation sign the petition. Property owners  vote to renew the BID  every five years. The assessment is levied by the municipality, but the BID is managed by its own board of directors, or the board of directors may designated a separate management entity, which could be an existing organization or a new one. Some of the eligible activities for BIDs include street cleaning, snow removal, litter and graffiti removal, washing sidewalks, producing and disseminating tourist guides, hosting special events, advertising, business recruitment and retention, sign and façade programs, parking management, streetscape improvements, historic preservation, and more.</p>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Main Street: </span>Main Street programs can be freestanding nonprofits, or they can be part of an economic development organization such as a BID or Community Development Corporation (CDC). Any Main Street program <a href="http://www.preservationnation.org/main-street/about-main-street/the-programs/local-programs.html#.UuF4vRAo5pg" target="_blank">&quot;must be a volunteer-driven effort that has support and participation from a variety of stakeholders in the revitalization effort.&quot;</a> Main Street programs carry out their mission with a small staff and volunteer committees and task forces and must <a href="http://www.preservationnation.org/main-street/about-main-street/the-programs/budgets-and-funding.html#.UuF7aBAo5pg" target="_blank">&quot;raise their own funds for projects and operations.&quot;</a></p>
	  <p>The <a href="http://www.preservationnation.org/main-street/" target="_blank">National Main Street Center, Inc.</a> (NMSC), a nonprofit subsidiary of the <a href="http://www.preservationnation.org/" target="_blank">National Trust for Historic Preservation</a>, is an excellent resource to learn about economic organization strategies that have worked to revitalize and reinvest in traditional downtowns. The national Main Streets program began in 1980 and is best known for its <a href="http://www.preservationnation.org/main-street/about-main-street/the-approach/#.UuFu6xAo5pg" target="_blank">Main Street Four-Point Approach®</a>: Organization, Promotion, Design, and Economic Restructuring. This four-point approach is guided by <a href="http://www.preservationnation.org/main-street/about-main-street/the-approach/eight-principles.html#.UuFvnhAo5pg" target="_blank">Eight Principles</a> for successful redevelopment: Comprehensive, Incremental, Self-help, Partnerships, Identifying and capitalizing on existing assets, Quality, Change, and Implementation.</p>
	  <p>There are thousands of traditional commercial districts throughout the country that have followed the Main Street Four-Point Approach® and have established Main Street organizations. <a href="http://www.preservationnation.org/main-street/about-main-street/getting-started/#.UuFygBAo5pg" target="_blank">Visit this page</a> to learn more about how to get started with establishing a Main Street organization.	Massachusetts does not have a statewide <a href="http://www.preservationnation.org/main-street/about-main-street/the-programs/coordinating-programs.html#.UuF9gBAo5pg" target="_blank">Coordinating Program</a>, though the City of Boston Department of Neighborhood Development does coordinate <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/dnd/obd/mainstreets.asp" target="_blank">Boston Main Streets</a>. Nevertheless, many Main Street organizations exist in the Commonwealth and we included information about two of them here.</p>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Examples: </span>The MAPC project team is familiar with numerous BIDs and Main Street programs throughout Massachusetts and nationwide. We provided a few examples here to generate ideas for what Downtown Lynn can do. If you are familiar with the examples provided here, think back to what these places were like ten or twenty years ago. Generally, these places are in traditional neighborhoods, usually Downtowns, with a mix of historic architecture and newer development. In most of the cases, these districts were struggling economically and faced competition from  malls, &quot;big box&quot; shopping complexes, and other destinations. In a few cases, these places faced high crimes rates, rampant illicit activities, poorly maintained streets and sidewalks, vacant storefronts. BIDs and Main Street programs help to bring business and property owners together and provide services of mutual benefit. They have proven to help districts like Downtown Lynn turn a corner from distressed to dynamic.</p>
	  <p>The MAPC Project Team learned about the work of the Downtown Boston BID, Providence Downtown Improvement District (DID), and Times Square Alliance <a href="http://www.architects.org/programs-and-events/urban-design-committee-lecture-bids-dids-20-beyond-green-clean" target="_blank">during a panel presentation</a> of the Boston Society of Architects' Urban Design Committee speaker series in February 2013. Additionally, the project team learned about the Westfield BID, the Downtown Taunton BID, and the Northampton BID at the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development's <a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/community/assistance-training/planning-and-community-development-conference-2013.html" target="_blank">Planning, Production, and Progress</a> conference in May 2013. We also provided two examples of successful Main Streets programs not too far from Downtown Lynn: Beverly Main Streets and Somerville's Union Square Main Streets. Each of these example organizations have  excellent websites and social media profiles, such as Twitter or Facebook, and to learn more, we recommend visiting these online resources as well as contacting the staff at these organizations. </p>

In just a few years, the Downtown Boston BID has made a visible impact, but as a relatively nascent organization, part of what makes its story compelling is the advocacy effort that led to establishment of the BID. The City of Boston launched the Downtown Crossing Economic Initiative in October 2004, and the Downtown Crossing Partnership complemented their efforts through advocacy and an active campaign effort to create the BID.</p>

Programs of the  Providence DID include the DID Clean Team, safety guides, a seasonal downtown planting program,  streetscape improvements, and the Hospitality Resource Partnership. The Hospitality Resource Partnership is a collaboration between the city, hospitality industry businesses such as restaurants and nightclubs, property owners, and the police to create vibrant and safe nightlife in Downtown.</p>
	  <p>Providence DID works with the <a href="http://www.provfoundation.com/" target="_blank">Providence Foundation</a> to market Downtown and advocate for economic development, including job creation and promoting Downtown a as place for businesses to locate and expand. The Providence DID works close with the <a href="http://www.providenceri.com/" target="_blank">City of Providence</a> to address Downtown needs.</p>

	  <p>Although the high-priced real estate in Time Square is  unaffordable for most people and companies, the Times Square Alliance has actively partnered with social service organizations, arts organizations, and other nonprofits to address challenges as well as to make public spaces welcoming to all people, regardless of income or employment. </p>
	  <p>The BID partnered with an organization called <a href="http://www.projectrenewal.org/" target="_blank">Project Renewal</a>, a substance abuse recovery organization, for its street cleaning services, thus providing job training and employment for people in need. The BID also partnered with <a href="http://www.commonground.org/" target="_blank">Common Ground</a> to provide the homeless with homes and address homelessness in other innovative ways. They also worked with the <a href="http://www.courtinnovation.org/project/midtown-community-court" target="_blank">Midtown Community Court</a> to address crime in ways more likely to reduce recidivism, and worked with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/" target="_blank">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> to address the concentration of adult uses by proposing zoning changes, which ultimately led the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/" target="_blank">Department of City Planning</a> to undertake similar studies citywide and subsequently, change zoning citywide. </p>
	  <p>Times Square is internationally known as a hub for theater and entertainment and creative partnerships and projects with numerous theater arts organizations and public space consultants have transformed the experience of a visit to Times Square, along with increasing Broadway theater attendance, supporting artists, and offering residents and visitors alike with programming that makes for a memorable experience.

During their <a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/docs/dhcd/cd/aat/westfieldbusiness.pdf" target="_blank">presentation at the May 2013 EOHED planning conference</a>, WBID staff discussed, among other programs, their Best Retail Practices Program, an initiative in which participants can attend a free workshop on visual examples of best retail practices and then can apply to be select for an in-store consultation which includes an assessment and recommendations. Finally, a few recipients of this consultation are awarded a grant to implement some of the recommendations identified in the assessment.

Highlights of their presentation included the metrics they used to communicate their value. The Northampton BID budget breakdown in FY 2013 was 17% for administrative costs, 6% on public safety programs, 38% on marketing programs, and 39% on maintenance programs. They pride themselves on the efficiency of their services; staff at the conference referenced timely snow removal and the quick clean-up after their First Night event among other programs - their sidewalk and curb cleaning services operate everyday, all year. The Northampton BID was established in 2009, and since then, hotel and room tax revenues, meals tax revenues, and parking revenues have all increased substantially. <a href="http://www.northamptondowntown.com/node/14" target="_blank">Members</a> of the BID restaurants, retail shops, service-oriented businesses, and nonprofit organizations including Smith College, a few area churches, and the Greater Northampton Chamber of Commerce.</p><table align="left">

      <span class="InlineHeadings">Downtown Taunton Business Improvement District:</span> Downtown Taunton's Business Improvement District and Foundation work together, complementing more traditional BID activities with community development activities such as housing development and renovating blighted properties.</span>Representatives from the Downtown Taunton BID were among the panelists at the May 2013 EOHED planning conference, where they <a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/docs/dhcd/cd/aat/businessimprovement.pdf" target="_blank">presented an overview of their innovative programs</a>. Downtown Taunton, Massachusetts is home to a Business Improvement District established in 2010 and a Foundation established in 2011, which together pursue a &quot;multi-faceted approach to revitalization.&quot; Their website, <a href="http://www.downtowntaunton.org/" target="_blank">www.downtowntaunton.org</a>, offers a concise guide to what the district has to offer. The BID's programs include security camera matching grants, snow removal, window washing, website design assistance and hosting, and real estate referrals. They work with the Foundation to purchase and renovate properties for a variety of uses that will strengthen the district, including: new homeownership opportunities, art galleries, affordable and market rate  apartments, office spaces, small businesses, a center for the arts, and a workforce training center. Downtown Taunton Foundation is a member of the <a href="http://macdc.org/" target="_blank">Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations</a> (MACDC).</p>

	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">4. Evaluate the role a certified  community development corporation (CDC) could play in Lynn</span> as a vehicle for  equitable development: such an organization could encourage diverse community  involvement, serve as a liaison between residents, municipal government, and  private developers, access resources such as foundation funding and Community  Investment Tax Credits from the state, and address affordable housing  development needs across the City. The <a href="http://macdc.org/" target="_blank">Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations (MACDC)</a> defines Community Development Corporations as organizations that &quot;engage local residents and businesses to work together to undertake community development programs, projects and activities, which develop and improve urban, rural and suburban communities in sustainable ways that create and expand economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income people&quot; (See <a href="http://macdc.org/node/91#What are CDCs?" target="_blank">&quot;What Are CDCs?&quot;</a> for more information). The Commonwealth of Massachusetts established a <a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/community/planning/cdc-certification.html" target="_blank">CDC certification process</a> in 2010 under <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleVII/Chapter40H" target="_blank">M.G.L. Chapter 40H</a>. In 2012, the <a href="http://macdc.org/community-investment-tax-credit" target="_blank">Community Investment Tax Credit (CITC)</a> was signed into law as  a mechanism to help certified CDCs develop &quot;high quality and high impact multi-year business plans for community improvement and economic development.&quot; These plans are reviewed by DHCD, which selects the strongest plans and allocates state tax credits that the CDC can use to attract significant private investment. Thirty percent of the available tax credits are intended for Gateway Cities (Lynn is a Gateway City). Currently in Lynn, <a href="http://lhand.org/" target="_blank">LHAND</a> and its nonprofit housing corporation subsidiary <a href="http://ndainc.org/" target="_blank">Neighborhood Development Associates, Inc. (NDA)</a> pursues  development activities similar to a CDC. The Community Minority Cultural Center Community Development Corporation is a CDC in Lynn; it is not certified but it is a member of MACDC. <a href="http://www.thecenterboard.org/" target="_blank">Centerboard </a> also offers some services that a CDC might offer. Finally, there are certified CDCs that operate in neighboring cities such as <a href="http://northshorecdc.org/" target="_blank">North Shore CDC</a> and <a href="http://www.theneighborhooddevelopers.org/" target="_blank">The Neighborhood Developers</a>, but they do not currently offer any services or have any projects in Lynn. In order to receive the benefits a certified CDC could offer, MAPC recommends that the city establish a new CDC, pursue CDC certification  of an existing community-based development organization, or partner with an  existing CDC to expand services into Lynn. A CDC could be coupled with a Business Improvement District or Main Street program as described above.</p> 
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">5. Connect  with the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development (EOHED)</span> for state resources, training,  collaboration, and networking opportunities. The City of Lynn, EDIC, and LHAND already access state resources from EOHED, but there are <a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/community/planning/guide/" target="_blank">many additional resources</a> offered by EOHED that could be tapped. Furthermore, many of the recommendations within this plan such as formation of a Business Improvement District or Certified Community Development Corporation would require increased collaboration with and assistance from EOHED. <a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/economic/" target="_blank">Learning more</a> about EOHED's Key Initiatives, Key Industries, and Regional Profiles may help position Lynn to access more of what the state has to offer. Agencies that are part of the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development include the following:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/economic/eohed/dhcd/" target="_blank">Department of Housing and Community Development</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/economic/eohed/bd/" target="_blank">Mass Office of Business Development</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://www.mass.gov/consumer" target="_blank">Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/economic/eohed/pro/" target="_blank">Massachusetts Permit Regulatory Office</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/economic/eohed/opmo/" target="_blank">Office of Performance Management and Oversight</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/economic/eohed/moiti/" target="_blank">Mass Office of International Trade and Investment</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://www.massvacation.com/" target="_blank">Mass Office of Travel and Tourism</a>	  </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">6. Cultivate  a positive image for Downtown Lynn by developing a marketing plan</span>, pursuing  cross-marketing opportunities, and working with business and business owners to serve as  spokespersons for the City – as recommended in the Economic Development Self  Assessment Tool for Lynn.	  </p>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">7. Work collaboratively with property owners, local banks, and public agencies to address property upkeep, turnover, and modernization across the district. </span>The analysis of <a href="/What_We_Learned/Property_Characteristics.html">property characteristics</a> conducted during this project, including interactive parcel maps, may be used to assist with this effort. Some tasks that will help to address property challenges are:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><span class="InlineHeadings">Identify properties that are in poor condition or vacant</span> in Downtown and develop a strategy for improving them, including a list of properties, resources for financing, and a process for acquisition and disposition if necessary. </li>
	    <li><span class="InlineHeadings">Identity needs for modernizing properties</span> and identify resources to support offset the costs of retrofitting historic/older buildings with  amenities that meet or exceed today's standards.</li>
	    <li><span class="InlineHeadings">Invest in a loan or grant program to assist commercial property  owners</span> with addressing Building, Sanitary, Health and Fire code violations in partnership with the local banking community as well as state and federal  programs.</li>
	    <li><span class="InlineHeadings">Maintain an up-to-date listing of available properties</span> as well as proactively identify potential commercial and institutional tenants. Assist property owners with  marketing and leasing to these prospective tenants, and work with property owners  to improve retention of these tenants.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">8. Build relationships with Downtown Lynn business owners</span> to learn more about their needs and address these needs as a strategy for encouraging them to stay in Downtown Lynn. Regularly  visit local businesses to strengthen these relations and to get to know business owners, particularly of immigrant-owned  businesses. Encourage business owners to connect with business networking  organizations and to take advantage of local business development programs. </p>
