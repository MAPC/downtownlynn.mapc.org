	  <p class="InlineHeadings">Promote community  stewardship of Downtown Lynn:</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">1. Embrace cross-sector collaboration  and coordination.</span> Existing models for cross-sector dialogues in Lynn include  the Team of Advisors that convened for this project as well as the Lynn Area  Chamber of Commerce Government Affairs Committee, which meets monthly, and the  stakeholders group that convened for the Downtown Lynn Cultural District  branding initiative. Groups such as these foster opportunities for  collaboration and creative problem-solving, increase understanding of what is  happening in the City, and allow issues of mutual concern to be aired and  addressed.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">2. Reconvene the public to revisit and  update the Vision for Downtown Lynn every five years.</span> Develop a sense of  commitment among all partners and stakeholders to achieving commonly shared principles,  values and goals for Downtown Lynn. Active community participation will help to  ensure that the community works towards improvements without losing sight of  what they like about Downtown the way it is now. </p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">3. Encourage community members to advocate  for Downtown Lynn.</span> Change can and should occur at all levels and in all  directions: top down, leading from the middle, or from the grassroots. Local  advocates can be allies for advocating for investment in Downtown Lynn from  state and regional resources, in partnership with their municipal government. They  also can ensure Lynn pursues a strategy of equitable development, helping give  voice to the interests of residents, small businesses, constituents with  limited English proficiency, members of protected classes, low and  middle-income households, and other groups that may be concerned about the  impacts associated with increased property values and higher rents. </p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">4. Continue to involve residents in  committees related to local planning and development</span>, such as the Off-Street  Parking Commission, to help increase understanding of land use and economic  development challenges and promote community solutions. Identify new and  meaningful roles for resident involvement.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">5. Cultivate new community leaders.  </span>Work closely with local nonprofits and institutions such as RAW Art Works,  Centerboard, North Shore Latino Business Association, North Shore Community  College, and Lynn Community Health Center to identify emerging leaders with  diverse backgrounds and establish opportunities for meaningful civic  engagement, participation, and possibly employment.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">6. Encourage corporate and  institutional stewardship of Lynn </span>by encouraging participation and investment  in local events and programs.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">7. Embrace Downtown Lynn's unique identity as an urban, diverse, mixed-income community </span>with a broad spectrum nonprofit organizations, government agencies, health and educational institutions, businesses, and housing types to support this complex identity.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">8. Promote a culture of honest dialogue to improve credibility and increase trust. </span>Sometimes this may mean being more open to critique and proactively sharing challenges or even failures, but allowing room for dissent or disagreement can lead to creative problem solving and a sense of collective stewardship and pride.</p></td>
