	  <p class="InlineHeadings">Improve coordination  and communications of municipal planning and land use development efforts:</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">1. Increase  the visibility of planning coordination and local development efforts. </span>Our  community interviews revealed that the city, developers, and nonprofit  organizations have undertaken many efforts to improve Downtown Lynn and the  city as whole, but that each of these various entities and the general public  are not always aware of all of these efforts. The danger in this lack of  awareness is that it can, and often does, lead to the perception that the city,  or other entities, are not doing their part. Furthermore, our conversations  revealed that some efforts overlap with others, or are being pursued in an  uncoordinated fashion (which is also stated in the <a href="http://www.cityoflynnoecd.net/documents/community/CEDS_Lynn_2012_4-1.25.12.pdf" target="_blank">Lynn: Economic Development  and Outlook</a> report by the <a href="http://www.salemstate.edu/5773.php" target="_blank">Salem State University Center for Economic  Development and Sustainability (CEDS)</a>, as well as other documents MAPC reviewed  in our research of previous <a href="/What_We_Learned/Downtown_Planning.html" class="InlineHeadings">Downtown Planning</a> efforts). Coordination of efforts  can help to create synergy and reduce inefficiency. Track and communicate  progress on the implementation of planning and development initiatives through  the City&rsquo;s website, announcements using traditional and social media, and by  convening advisory groups or public meetings. Regularly revisit the goals and  objectives identified in these initiatives to identify milestones and update  priorities.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">2. Update  city and agency websites</span> and create a central repository for planning and local  development documents.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">3. Clarify  and communicate the roles and responsibilities</span> of all municipal departments,  public agencies, councils, boards, commissions, and committees involved in city  planning and economic development.Â   Publish roles and responsibilities on the website, as well as in  documents such a business/permitting guide. See our <a href="/Our_Recommendations/Business_Vitality.html" class="InlineHeadings">Business Vitality</a> recommendations for an example of another community's business/permitting guide.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">4. Centralize  citywide master planning</span> and long-range planning functions.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">5. Obtain  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology</span> and train city planning and  development staff to use it. Consider hiring GIS developers and analysts to manage  the City&rsquo;s geographic database, which may be of use to other departments  including but not limited Inspectional Services, Engineering, Assessor, and  Public Works.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">6. Create  a Planning Director position</span> for the City and fill the position with a  qualified, experienced professional city planner with a Masters degree in city  planning or a related field, with at least five years of professional  experience.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">7. Create  day-to-day coordination role</span> between city planning staff and the Inspectional  Services Department for development review and zoning enforcement.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">8. Undertake  a citywide master planning effort and revise or rewrite the Lynn Zone Ordinance</span> to coordinate with the new master plan. Ensure that capital plans, work plans,  and local policies are aligned with the master plan and Lynn Zone Ordinance.</p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">9. Become  a more active participant in regional and statewide planning activities</span>, as  convened by the <a href="http://www.mapc.org/" target="_blank">Metropolitan Area Planning Council</a> (including the Inner Core  Committee and North Shore Coalition), the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/" target="_blank">Executive Office of Housing and  Economic Development</a>, and other state and regional agencies.</p></td>
