      <div class="Caption">The 2003 Residential Reuse Overlay successfully led to the redevelopment of several underutilized buildings into new loft condominiums, resulting in about 200 new residents in Downtown. Now, there's limited opportunity within the parameters of existing zoning to create new residences in the Central Business District. The recommendations here support what we heard from the community: that new residential development is needed and would be supported in Downtown Lynn.

      <div class="Caption">At the <a href="/Who_We_Met/Public_Forum.html">May 2013 Open House and Public Forum</a>, when we asked if people would like to live in Downtown as it is now, two-thirds of the participants said they would not. It seemed that amenities, such as more attractive streets and buildings, more dining and entertainment options, activities and destinations for families, and parks and other places to gather safely could make a difference: 56% of participants indicated they would enjoy living in Downtown Lynn if there were more amenities.</p>
      <p>A critical part of ensuring that new residential development in Downtown Lynn is marketable will be to make it easier to create this &quot;live-work-play-learn&quot; environment by allowing more uses as-of-right and promoting mixed use development.</div></td></tr>

    </table>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Amend  the City of Lynn Zone Ordinance to promote a live-work-play-learn environment in Downtown.</span> Downtown Lynn has all the makings of a vibrant downtown: a mix of places to live, work, dine, shop, relax, recreate, and learn. It also has historic architecture, transit access, sidewalks that make it easy to walk around. The zoning amendments recommended here will help set the stage for Downtown to realize its potential by making it easier attract more residents and businesses, no longer allowing incompatible land uses, and creating design guidelines that will foster thoughtful redevelopment. </p>
	  <p class="InlineHeadings">1. <span class="InlineHeadings">Minimize requirement for special  permits</span> in Central Business District (CBD) zoning for uses that would promote  an active downtown environment, subject to appropriate size and design  guidelines. </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Allow  residential as of right under carefully defined conditions. (See  Recommendations 2 and 3 for more specificity). </li>
	    <li>Allow  eating and drinking establishments (except with drive-through and bar-only  establishments) as-of-right to encourage a growing downtown dining scene.</li>
	    <li>Allow  hotel, conference centers, and certain research and development uses in  Downtown to attract visitors and a larger workforce. </li>
	    <li>When  Special Permit is required, consider giving the Planning Board the permit  granting authority in place of the City Council to expedite the process and  better link to City planning activities. </li>
	    <li>Look  to the Washington Street Corridor overlay and its allowed uses (residential and  commercial) as a model for CBD.</li>
      </ul>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">2. Phase out the Residential Reuse  Overlay</span> by incorporating residential reuse language into the underlying CBD  zoning. The Residential Reuse Overlay was established in 2003 and it was  extremely effective and resulted in several housing redevelopments in Downtown  and helped to preserve historic buildings. Now, however, there are few  remaining opportunities for residential reuse in downtown. Furthermore, it is  confusing as the overlay is buried in the use table as a footnote, and seems to  be intended as a transit-oriented development overlay. Also, the overlay only  leaves out a few CBD parcels on the periphery and does not apply to non-CBD  zoned parcels located near MBTA Central Square station, such as the parcels  currently zoned as Light Industrial immediately adjacent to the station. </p>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">3. Allow new residential use</span>,  including multifamily residential/mixed-use developments, in the CBD as of  right if they meet specific criteria, or by establishing a 40R district.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Ensure  new construction is compatible with the existing character and scale of Downtown  by incorporating strong design guidelines into the ordinance.</li>
	    <li>Require  active ground floor uses for projects along key corridors (e.g., Market St.,  Washington St., Central Ave., etc).</li>
	    <li>Continue  to require Special Permits for large residential/mixed-use projects that exceed  certain unit or square footage thresholds (to be determined).</li>
	    <li>Consider  adopting a 40R district (or districts) in the CBD. Establishing a 40R district  may be advantageous for the City as it would allow for multifamily as of right  in the downtown, provide the city with bonus payments from the State for each  unit planned at the time the building permit is issued, and provide a zoning  incentive payment when the district is adopted. 40R also guarantees developers  a shorter review process (a maximum of 180 days). Further, the City would be  reimbursed by the State through Chapter 40S for any net costs of educating  students who live in the housing. (For more information on Chapter 40R and 40S,  <a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/community/planning/" target="_blank">click here</a>.)</li>
      </ul>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">4. Review definitions within the Lynn  Zone Ordinance</span>, and amend as needed to promote an active downtown environment. </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Identify  contradicting definitions and clarify allowed uses. </li>
	    <li>Add  more specificity to food service establishment uses by defining different types  of establishments with different requirements for each (e.g., the food service  establishment definition should be divided into subcategories, each with appropriate  requirements). </li>
	    <li>Do  not allow automotive uses in Downtown including automobile repair, service  stations, or drive-through facilities.</li>
      </ul>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">5. Add additional design guidelines to  CBD zoning </span>for all development types (residential, commercial and mixed-use) to  ensure new structures are compatible with surrounding character and scale. </p>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">6. Eliminate the Light Industrial (LI)  zones adjacent to the MBTA Central Square station</span> in Downtown incorporate these  parcels into the Central Business District (CBD), which will expand  redevelopment opportunities that promote Downtown&rsquo;s identity as a  live-work-play-learn destination.</p>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">7. Revise parking requirements within  the CBD</span> to better reflect parking needs in a downtown environment. </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Refine  parking requirements for multifamily development in downtown. Potential  changes: 1 per studio, 1.25 per 1-bedroom, 1.5 per 2-bedroom, and 2 for  3-bedroom units. </li>
	    <li>Reduce  office parking requirements to 3 per 1,000 gsf. </li>
	    <li>Significantly  reduce or do not require off-street parking for ground floor retail in the CBD.</li>
	    <li>Identify  opportunities for shared parking, where usage of parking facilities will not be  needed simultaneously (e.g., residential and office). </li>
	    <li>Work  with MBTA to better utilize the existing parking structure for residential use overnight.  Community members have indicated that there is frequently a surplus of  available parking, but that signage directing traffic towards these parking  spaces could be improved, and measures to improve the experience of parking,  such as perception of personal safety, could be improved with added lighting  and security.</li>
      </ul>
	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">8. Make the ordinance easier to follow and understand </span>when revising (or rewriting) the Lynn  Zone Ordinance. Use  graphics where appropriate to demonstrate requirements and intent, and develop  summary sheets highlighting key requirements (setbacks, heights, massing, etc.)  with illustrative graphics to provide more clarity. The <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/pub/zonehand.shtml" target="_blank">New York City  Zoning Handbook</a> and New York City's Department of City Planning's <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/subcats/zoning.shtml" target="_blank">Zoning</a> website are good examples to review, as shown on the right.</p></td>
