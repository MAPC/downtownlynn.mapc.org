<h3>Downtown Planning</h3>
<p><span class="InlineHeadings">Recent planning studies for Downtown, the Waterfront, and citywide economic development strategies </span>helped  inform MAPC's understanding of Downtown needs and goals. Many of these studies are available on the <a href="http://www.cityoflynnoecd.net/community.shtml" target="_blank">Community Planning page</a> of the City of Lynn's <a href="http://www.cityoflynnoecd.net/index.shtml" target="_blank">Department of Community Development website</a>, and a few are from other sources.

  <td>The May 2005 <span class="InlineHeadings">Lynn Economic Development Strategy </span>by RKG Associates, Inc. recommended continuing to build the momentum created by the 2004 charrette and workshop for Downtown. This strategy includes citywide recommendations and specific strategies for eight &quot;economic opportunity zones&quot; including Downtown. The Department of Community Development website has the <a href="http://www.cityoflynnoecd.net/documents/community/City of Lynn Economic Strategy.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix for this strategy</a> available online; MAPC obtained a hardcopy of the main report from the City for our review.
    <p>The Economic Development Strategy consultant team conducted a survey of business owners and interviewed major employers and property owners, along with analyzing Lynn's tax base, land use, and demographic characteristics. Of the 40 business owners surveyed, 78% indicated &quot;Downtown Revitalization&quot; was a long-term opportunity for the city. Many of the recommendations overlap or build on recommendations made during the 2004 workshop. The strategy included a list of target projects for Downtown for $1.5-3.5 million in short-term investment and $12.7-24.9 million in long-term investments. The projects listed included some that were underway at the time of the study, as well as projects in the pipeline that would add hundreds of new residential units, thousands of new non-residential square feet, dozens of new jobs and millions in new real estate taxes.</p>
    <p class="InlineHeadings">Some of the recommendations from this strategy include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increasing the City's responsiveness and outreach to business owners to encourage retention and promote expansion of existing businesses</li>
      <li>Establishing a mechanism for the Mayor and City Council to track and review its progress towards meeting planning and economic development goals</li>
      <li>Develop a clear organizational framework for the City to coordinate planning efforts and implement recommendations</li>
      <li>Continuing to advocate for the Blue Line extension</li>
      <li>Offering density bonuses for new construction and allowing 10 story buildings</li>
      <li>Establishing a redevelopment fund of $2 million to invest in high priority projects and utilizing District Improvement Financing (DIF) along with private investment to stimulate economic activity in Downtown</li>

  <td>The July 2007 <span class="InlineHeadings"><a href="http://www.cityoflynnoecd.net/community_parking.shtml" target="_blank">Downtown Parking Study</a></span> by BETA Group, Inc. evaluated parking in the Central Business District following zoning changes to allow residential reuse of existing buildings in the district and the resulting  increase in residential condominium and rental units in Downtown. At the time, the City was considering an overnight on-street parking ban in Downtown and wanted to determine whether municipal lots could accommodate overnight parking for residents and their visitors. The study included an inventory of  spaces, fees, utilization, safety, parking technology, and management recommendations. 
    <p>According to the consultants' analysis, existing municipal parking lots were underutilized and could accommodate &quot;all of the overnight on-street parked vehicles observed, as well as the overnight parking generated by future planned residential developments&quot; (BETA Group, page 2). They also recommended lighting, surveillance cameras, and emergency call boxes to reduce the risk of crime and improve the feeling of safety in municipal lots.</p>
    <p>During daytime hours, the Blake and Spring Street lots approached their capacity but the other municipal lots on Andrew Street, Buffum Street, Ellis Street, and Union Street had surplus parking available at all times. The consultants also noted that on-street parking at the time was underutilized, with 55% of the on-street parking capacity in use during peak hours.</p>
    <p>To accommodate the anticipated increase in demand and manage parking, BETA Group suggested issuing different types of color-coded parking permits for day, night, and &quot;24/7&quot; parking in the municipal lots and adding meters to on-street spaces in high demand areas.</p></td>

The plan proposes changing this underutilized land from industrial uses into three distinct neighborhood districts: the Gateway Waterfront Neighborhood, the Downtown Waterfront, and Lower Sagamore Hill. These districts would include new residential construction complemented by commercial/retail businesses, offices, and hotel development. Additionally, the plan includes a fourth district called the Marine Park Industry Center, which includes industrial and marine-dependent operations as well as some offices. The plan proposes zoning changes, offers a conceptual land use and urban design plan, and discusses property acquisition and environmental remediation needs. It suggests that phasing for the project, which is dependent on acquisition and environmental remediation, but also developer interest.

The plan's focus area is the approximately 60 acres bound by Market Street, Broad Street, Washington Street, and Essex Street. The goals of the plan were to upgrade property values in Downtown and to identify land use, zoning, streetscape, and transportation improvements that would stimulate economic investment.
    <p>The plan suggests a number of specific urban design improvements to enhance Downtown's appearance, improve streetscaping and landscaping, create gateways, add park space, and make the district more appealing for walking. It also suggests opportunities for infill development, added structured parking, zoning changes, and improve traffic circulation. </p>
    <p><span class="InlineHeadings">The action plan</span> on pages 34-35 identifies the following recommendations (the bold headings in the action plan by VHB are listed here verbatim, but refer to the full document for more details):</p>

      <li>Invest in establishing a prominent gateway entry to downtown via Market Street</li>

    <p>The July 2011 <span class="InlineHeadings">Economic Development Self Assessment Tool Report</span> (<a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/dukakiscenter/econdev/edsat-background/" target="_blank">EDSAT</a>) by the Dukakis Center and in partnership with the <a href="http://www.nlc.org/" target="_blank">National League of Cities</a> is a municipal self-assessment of business friendly practices, using a series of questions that businesses consider when evaluating locations. The questions were developed based upon a survey of real estate and location professionals from the <a href="https://www.naiop.org/" target="_blank">National Association of Industrial and Office Properties</a> (NAIOP) , a commercial real estate development association, and <a href="http://www.corenetglobal.org/" target="_blank">CoreNet Global</a>, an association for &quot;corporate real estate (CRE) and workplace professionals, service providers and economic developers&quot; (<a href="http://www.corenetglobal.org/About/index.cfm#.UtAAovQy_Kc" target="_blank">About Us</a>, CoreNet Global). The Dukakis Center asks municipal officials, business leaders, and civic leaders to &quot;come together as a team for self assessment&quot; (Lynn EDSAT, page 3). Their responses are then compared with nearby municipalities. The report for Lynn was used with permission from Mayor Kennedy's office, as it is not a public document available online. Some highlights from the EDSAT, organized by theme, are noted below.</p>
    <p class="InlineHeadings">Partnerships and collaboration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Partnerships between the City, EDIC, and Lynn Area Chamber of Commerce are a strength</li>
      <li>Lynn should work more closes with regional and state planning and development agencies and organizations.</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="InlineHeadings">Business attraction, retention, and marketing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lynn's EDIC maintains a <a href="http://ediclynn.org/realestate.html" target="_blank">list of development sites</a>, which is a strength</li>
      <li>Lynn can improve business friendliness by establishing a formal procedure to check in on firm satisfaction and addressing areas of dissatisfaction.</li>
      <li>Lynn can collect data from developers and businesses about their location decisions when the choose Lynn, as well as for when they consider Lynn but opt for another municipality</li>
      <li>At the time when the EDSAT was written, a clean technology business incubator that had located in Downtown Lynn was touted as a strength - but the incubator has since moved out of the City to another North Shore community.</li>
      <li>Lynn should design a marketing plan with input from location and industry specialists to address and correct misconceptions about Lynn as well as to rebrand the City. The City should use spokespersons from local businesses to speak on behalf of the City as a way of cross-marketing</li>
      <li>Lynn could benefit from exploring business incentives offered by the state</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="InlineHeadings">Permitting:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lynn's overlay districts help to expedite permitting for certain land uses<br>
      </li>
      <li>Lynn should provide prospective businesses and developers a checklist of permitting requirements, a flow chart of the permitting process, and a developer handbook</li>
      <li>Lynn needs to streamline permitting and site plan review, along with implementing an expedited permitting process</li>
      <li>Abutters, organized neighborhood groups, and unions slow the permitting process in Lynn more than in comparison group municipalities</li>
      <li>Lynn should establish an ombudsperson or team to review and streamline the permitting process, as well as serve as the primary point of contact for prospective businesses and developers</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="InlineHeadings">Property conditions and redevelopment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lynn's system of code enforcement for nuisances on abandoned property and trash, along with the system for monitoring code violations, which is a strength</li>
      <li>Lynn helps to clear the liens for new owners by seeking tax abatements for tax title properties, which is likely to have long-term economic development benefits for the City</li>
      <li>Lynn could create a process to reclaim tax delinquent properties or abandoned or underutilized shopping centers for redevelopment, to help prevent stagnation and stimulate redevelopment</li>
      <li>Many commercial development sites are in need of renovations or are vacant</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="InlineHeadings">Location advantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arts and culture amenities are advantageous for economic development and  the arts community can play a role in downtown</li>
      <li>Retail space rents are lower in the CBD than comparison group municipalities, which is advantageous, but the City could benefit from a higher proportion of Class A space</li>
      <li>Lynn's access to commuter rail, future access to a commuter ferry, and its proximity to the airport are advantageous location factors</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="InlineHeadings">Resources to improve transportation conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lynn could benefit from having a transportation specialist on staff</li>
      <li>Lynn has not used state or federal infrastructure grants to improve parking</li>
    </ul></td>

Crosby, President of the North Shore Labor Council. The project was funded in part by the <a href="http://www.umb.edu/lrc/fowri" target="_blank">Future of Work Research Initiative</a>, a joint project of the Labor Centers at the various University of Massachusetts campuses.
    <p>In the Forward for this report,  Carly McClain describes the New Lynn Coalition as &quot;comprised of union and  community groups in Lynn, MA who have a solid base in the community and have a  history of working together to improve conditions for all people in Lynn. The  coalition&rsquo;s mission is to organize all sectors of working class people in the  region into a unified permanent, political, and economic force that includes  those in unions as well as unorganized and transcends racial, linguistic,  ethnic, citizenship, and gender boundaries&rdquo; (New Lynn Coalition, 6).</p>
    <p>Key findings in that report included  data on demographics, income level, poverty, educational attainment,  foreclosures, and health issues. The goal of the New Lynn Coalition is to  create a &ldquo;New Lynn&rdquo; in four distinct, but integrally connected ways: politics,  economic development, research, and culture and education (6). The report  states &ldquo;to build momentum to help change Lynn for the better, we need to  increase civic engagement at many levels&rdquo; (New Lynn Coalition 28). </p>
    <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Promoting civic engagement and equitable development are key</span> to ensuring Downtown Lynn is able to retain what makes it unique, such as its multicultural diversity and its arts and culture scene, as property values increase and Downtown becomes more prosperous. </p></td>

  <td>In December 2011, consultant <a href="http://marthaalmy.com/" target="_blank">Martha Almy</a> delivered a <span class="InlineHeadings">presentation on branding the Lynn arts and culture district</span> culminating three months of meeting with Downtown Lynn arts and culture stakeholders as part of the <a href="http://www.massculturalcouncil.org/programs/adamsarts.asp" target="_blank">Massachusetts Cultural Council Adams Art Program</a> grant award to the <a href="http://www.lynnmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Lynn Museum</a>.

    <p><span class="InlineHeadings">The presentation addressed perception challenges, building the brand, and suggested directions.</span> Current perception of Downtown Lynn, as compiled by Ms. Almy, included negative images and associations that Lynn tries to battle, as well as positive images and associations that Lynn can build its brand on. As she puts it, &quot;the district is invested in changing perception through action,&quot; which includes &quot;building the brand.&quot; She provided suggestions for a mission statement, changing the district name from the initial &quot;Central Exchange Cultural District,&quot; possible slogans, logo and style considerations, imagery and voice, signage, website design, and social media outreach. </p>
    <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Ms. Almy also addressed marketing</span> the city, the district, and individual organizations with a coordinated approach and consistent messaging that ties back to the district's mission. Additionally, she proposed district specific programming such as continuing with Third Thursdays, which were already in place at the time of this presentations, as well as opportunities to showcase street art through what she called &quot;The Decade Project.&quot; Finally, she suggested marketing the &quot;Food and Fun&quot; Downtown Lynn and the Waterfront have to offer, and better connecting these assets for visitors. </p>
    <p>The presentation included a three year plan and next steps. It  led directly to the brand and brand elements that currently exist, including the district name (Downtown Lynn Cultural District, or DTLCD, which members of the stakeholders group voted for), the <a href="http://dtlcd.org">dtlcd.org</a> website, associated social media, logo, brand  elements and &quot;voice.&quot;</p></td>

The authors of this report stated &quot;Lynn does not necessarily need more studies to become successful in their economic development initiatives, rather a plan to collect feedback on a regular basis and produce an annual update, taking the temperature of the community. The results should be shared with the broader region and re-evaluate efforts annually. Use the education and training connections already established in the city. Much of the needed research can be ascertained with a partnership between city departments (who already collect and summarize results regularly), the educational/ training organizations, and other organizations interested in economic development&quot; (Duclos-Orsello, Hamilton, and Krebs, page 7).</p></td>
  <td>In April 2012, the <a href="http://www.salemstate.edu/5773.php" target="_blank">Center for Economic Development and Sustainability (CEDS) at Salem State University</a> published a report for the <a href="http://lynnareachamber.com/" target="_blank">Lynn Area Chamber of Commerce</a> called <a href="http://www.cityoflynnoecd.net/documents/community/CEDS_Lynn_2012_4-1.25.12.pdf" target="_blank" class="InlineHeadings">Lynn: Economic Development and Outlook</a> by Elizabeth Duclos-Orsello, William Hamilton, and Lorri Krebs.
    <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Findings in this report are based on the premise that &quot;economic success&quot; for a city is &quot;the collective ability of a community to create new net wealth for its residents over a sustained period of time&quot;</span> (Duclos-Orsello et. al., page 1). The report emphasizes that the City's economic development strategy must go beyond traditional tools such as attracting businesses to the community with tax breaks, as such incentives do not address community needs and thus are incomplete because &quot;community development and economic development in today's society are linked in such a way that one cannot prosper without consideration of the other (Greenwood and Holt, 2010), thereby placing a certain amount to importance on factors that are not necessarily measurable using traditional economic tools&quot; (Duclos-Orsello et. al., page 2). A combination of traditional economic development tools along with consideration for &quot;existing social networks and social capital,&quot; &quot;participatory arts and cultural opportunities,&quot; and &quot;multiple and overlapping 'community' identities&quot; (Duclos-Orsello et. al., page 2 are what will lead to economic prosperity for a city and its citizens.</p>
    <p><span class="InlineHeadings">For Lynn specifically, the report recommends these actions for Lynn </span>(Duclos-Orsello et. al. page 8):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a vision for the City and hold community meetings to integrate feedback and achieve buy-in</li>
      <li>Develop a community asset map that highlights the City's competitive advantages, noting &quot;existing infrastructures (physical, governmental, virtual, and educational) and cultural nuances (innovation, entrepreneurship and collaboration,&quot; and use this as a tool for future marketing efforts</li>
      <li>Develop and market a &quot;brand identity&quot; for the City</li>
      <li>Pursue a business support strategy and create and maintain inventory of properties</li>
      </ul>

  <td>Another  project funded by the Metro Boston Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant was called <a href="http://www.mapc.org/project-summaries" target="_blank" class="InlineHeadings">From Mills to Main Streets: Reaching, Connecting, and Engaging Immigrant Entrepreneurs</a>, a project led by the <a href="http://www.ilctr.org/" target="_blank">Immigrant Learning Center</a> in collaboration with the <a href="http://macdc.org/" target="_blank">Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations</a> (MACDC) and <a href="http://www.massinc.org/" target="_blank">MassINC</a>. The purpose of this project was to help develop support infrastructure for immigrant entrepreneurs in Gateway Cities, by training community and economic development professionals in techniques for engaging and supporting immigrant business owners, as well as to build relationships and networks between community and economic development organizations and immigrant businesses. The Immigrant Learning Center, MACDC, and MassINC chose Lynn as the location for a pilot project. As part of this effort, they worked with Ferrufino Consulting &amp; Associates to conduct the <span class="InlineHeadings">City of Lynn Immigrant Business Resources Access Survey</span>. Ferrufino Consulting surveyed 112 businesses across Lynn, particularly in Downtown and along Western Avenue.
    <p>Of the businesses surveyed, 42% had been in business for 5 years or less, while 13% of those surveyed had been in business for more than three decades. Most were small businesses;, 65 of the businesses surveyed reported having 0-5 employees. Types of businesses varied but the most common categories identified were   restaurants (23 of those surveyed), beauty (19), market (10), and clothing (7). </p>
    <p>Business owners' countries of origin included the United States (24 businesses, or 32% of those surveyed), the Dominican Republic (19 businesses, 26%), Cambodia (4 businesses, 5%), Vietnam (4 businesses, 5%), Bangladesh (3 businesses, 4%), Puerto Rico (3 businesses, 4%) and many other countries and regions. English proficiency varied among the business owners, and additional languages spoken among those surveyed include: Spanish, Bengali, Cambodian, Greek, Mandarin, Khmer, Vietnamese, Portuguese, Pushto, and Punjabi. </p>
    <p><span class="InlineHeadings">In terms of these business owners' networks within the business community</span>, 74% of those who responded indicated that they do not belong to a business networking group, while about 8% said they belong to the North Shore Latino Business Association, 5% said they belong to the Lynn Area Chamber of Commerce, 3% said they belong to the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and 10% identified other organizations and networks.</p>
    <p>Many of these businesses, 39%, do not access resources and support services for their businesses. Those who do access resources get their information from government agencies (15%), newspapers, flyers, or ads (10%), the Internet (6%), their accountants (5%), banks (5%), through networking (5%), and other sources.</p>
    <p>Many of these businesses rely on their personal finances to support the business, while others have accessed financing from banks (25%), private investment (18%), City Hall (7%) and other sources.</p>
    <span class="InlineHeadings">Respondents were asked to identify three immediate needs and the consultant ranked them by number of responses:</span>
Advertisement (24 responses), customers (21), Parking (11), Financing (6), Networking (5), Security (4), Technical Assistance (2), and Licensing (2).
    <p>Survey results were  provided to the MAPC project team by the consultant. MAPC is also the grant administrator for this project and has provided some assistance with scoping and managing it. The project also included training workshops and will include a final report by MassINC, which is forthcoming.</p></td>

  <td>The keynote address at the 2013 Lynn Area Chamber of Commerce Annual Meeting and Awards Dinner on February 5, 2013 was delivered by Dr. Barry Bluestone of the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/dukakiscenter/" target="_blank">Northeastern University's Dukakis Center for Urban Research and Policy</a>. His keynote was about economic development in Lynn, using results from the Lynn EDSAT (see above) as the basis for much of his presentation. According to Dr. Bluestone, &quot;economic development is a collaborative process that builds strong, adaptive economies and requires leadership,&quot; and &quot;companies and people move to municipalities, not states.&quot; He argues that  the challenge for places across the country in the 21<sup>st</sup> century is the ability &quot;to retain and attract young working families and young businesses&quot; and that those places that achieve this goal &quot;will remain prosperous.&quot;
    <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Bluestone encouraged the city to turn the &quot;deal breakers&quot; identified in the EDSAT into &quot;deal makers&quot; and to integrate economic development goals into master planning.</span> He emphasized that Lynn has &quot;great potential&quot; and is on the cusp of a Renaissance, but that the city needs to pursue more regional collaboration. He noted progress on cooperation between the city and its businesses in advancing economic development goals. He noted opportunities that ferry service could open up, particularly in connecting Lynn to other economic hubs such as the Innovation District in the Boston Seaport and New Quincy Center south of Boston - he calls this potential economic link between Quincy, Boston, and Lynn the New &quot;Fertile Crescent&quot; (Quotations from Dr. Bluestone's presentation slides, as provided to the MAPC project team).</p>
    <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Lynn has the potential to thrive in the 21<sup>st</sup> century</span> as a place for young families and innovative businesses to prosper and where visitors from around the region will go to enjoy arts, culture, and restaurants.</p></td>
