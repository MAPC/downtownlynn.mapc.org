<p><span class="InlineHeadings">Zoning  is tied directly to the success of Downtown Lynn, as it is the key mechanism  for directing desired growth within the community. </span>Zoning provides the legal  framework for what can and cannot be developed on every parcel of land within downtown  and the larger community. This includes the types of uses that are or are not  allowed, the massing and siting of structures, the amount of required parking, and  environmental and open space considerations.</p>
<p>Thus a review of downtown zoning in the <a href="http://lynnma.gov/cityhall_documents/isd/City%20of%20Lynn%20Zone%20Ordinance%20DEC%202010.pdf" target="_blank" class="InlineHeadings">City of  Lynn&rsquo;s Zone Ordinance (with Amendments through December, 2010)</a> was undertaken  as part of the project. The purpose of the review was to identify potential impediments  to desired development within the study area. Analysis focused on identifying those  uses that can be built as of right, those that require special permit approval,  and those that are prohibited. In addition, the zone ordinance was reviewed to  better understand various procedures required for project approval.</p>
<span class="InlineHeadings">Key Findings:</p>
</span>
<ul>
  <li>The zone ordinance is old, has many  amendments, and not intuitive.</li>
  <li>Use allowances and definitions within the  ordinance are often too general, confusing, and at times contradictory. </li>
  <li>The vast majority of study area parcels fall  within the Central Business District (CBD) zone, which allows primarily for  institutional, office and retail uses as of right. </li>
  <li>Many uses typically allowed as of right  within a downtown either require a special permit by the City Council (e.g. new  residential) or are not allowed at all within the CBD, and may adversely impact  the ability of the city to draw developers to downtown.</li>
  <li>Adaptive reuse artist/live-work residential  units are allowed as of right in the Residential Reuse Overlay, as long as 75  percent of ground floor is used for retail. However limited opportunity remains  as most eligible buildings have been converted. </li>
  <li>Outdated, light industrial districts remain  within the study area. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="InlineHeadings">The Zone Ordinance: 
  </span>Originally approved in June 1925, the existing Lynn  Zone Ordinance is outdated. However, rather than undertaking a full rewrite  process to reflect changing perspectives regarding preferred land use and development  patterns, the city has chosen to adopt numerous amendments to the dated  ordinance over the years. This includes revisions to existing district  requirements along with the addition of new overlay districts, to better  promote or prohibit certain uses in targeted areas. This process has resulted  in an ordinance that is difficult to navigate, is alternatively too general or  complex, and at times contradicts itself. As a result, it can be difficult to  decipher what is and what is not allowed to be built, thus eliminating the  predictability favored by developers and businesses looking to invest in the  city.  </p>
<h4><span class="InlineHeadings">Downtown Zoning Districts</span></h4>
<p>Four base zoning districts and three overlay zoning  districts were identified within the downtown study area. They are listed  below, followed by a more detailed analysis of each.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Central  Business District (CBD)</li>
  <li>Business  Districts (B)</li>
  <li>High Rise  Residential District (R-5)</li>
  <li>Light  Industrial District (LI)</li>
  <li>Residential  Re-use Overlay District</li>
  <li>Sagamore Hill  Corridor Overlay District (SHCO)</li>
  <li>Washington  Street Overlay District (WS)</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="InlineHeadings">Central Business District (CBD):</span> The overwhelming majority of downtown study area  parcels are included within the Central Business District (CBD) zoning.  Unfortunately, CBD zoning in many ways constrains the type of development often  associated with successful downtown live, work and play environments. Although  the CBD zone allows for many institutional and commercial uses as of right  (e.g. retail, general office, professional offices, schools, public buildings,  and others), several uses typically allowed as-of-right within downtowns  require a special permit by the City Council in Lynn. This may deter potential  investment in the downtown area, as it presents an uncertain outcome for  developers of proposed projects. </p>
<p> The most significant development constraint within  downtown is the special permit requirement for new residential development - a  key component to successful downtown areas and transit-oriented communities. Currently, only residential projects with up to 25 units are allowed as of right  in the Residential Reuse Overlay District (for more information on the overlay,  see below). New residential construction of any type, not just multifamily, is  only allowed through a special permit process. This creates uncertainty for  those looking to develop residential in downtown as there is no guarantee the  projects for which they might invest pre-development resources will be approved.  Nor does it send the message to the development community that residential is a  priority for downtown when it can be denied through a special permit process. </p>
<p> Similarly, some commercial uses that enliven  downtown streets also require a special permit in Lynn. This includes downtown  staples such as eating and drinking establishments of any kind, places of  assembly, private recreation (fitness centers), and hotels. Other  common uses are not allowed even by special permit. These include conference  centers and research and development (R&amp;D) facilities, both of which bring  visitors and workers to a downtown, thus increasing the consumer base for  downtown retail establishments. While these uses are not permitted, several non-pedestrian oriented uses  not typically found in downtown environments, like sales rooms for motor  vehicles and drive-through banks, are allowed as of right.</p>
<p>Further complicating developer or business owner  certainty, some use descriptions appear to contradict what is and is not allowed. For example, the use table indicates manufacturing is not allowed in  the CBD even by special permit, but General Office, which is allowed as of  right, is defined as &ldquo;Offices used for a general range of businesses and  business services, including, but not limited to, any manufacturing or  manufacturing related assembly.&rdquo; It appears that manufacturing or assembly may  be allowed as an office use, or it may be an attempt to allow for uses like  Research and Development (R&amp;D), which typically include office space  associated with some limited (but non-production) manufacturing or research.  This lack of clarification may deter interested parties from developing uses  that are perceived to be incompatible with industrial activity (e.g.  residential). Even if no industrial use is currently operating in the area, it  does not mean it would not be able to in the future under the current zoning.</p>
<p> <span class="InlineHeadings">Business District: </span>A scattering of parcels in the northwestern section  of the study area are zoned as Business (B). Essentially, the business district  zoning allows for the same uses as the CBD; however, some light industrial uses  are also allowed (e.g. contractor&rsquo;s storage yard), and artist/live/work spaces  are prohibited. It is unclear why these parcels were not included in the CBD,  and the City may wish to rezone them as such.</p>
<p><span class="InlineHeadings">Light Industrial: </span>Several parcels south of the commuter rail tracks  remain zoned as Light Industrial (LI), a remnant from the city&rsquo;s industrial  past. LI districts only allow for light manufacturing, limited institutional,  and agricultural uses as of right with site plan review. Many of these uses are  typically considered incompatible with a live-work-play environment. Fortunately,  existing uses on the sites, such as the Eastern Bank office, better reflect  those allowed within the surrounding CBD district. However, the site&rsquo;s  development, which is close to the commuter rail station, does not encourage a  pedestrian-friendly, active urban environment, as it is set back considerably from  the road and surrounded by surface parking.</p>
<p> <span class="InlineHeadings">High Rise Building District: </span>High Rise Building Districts (R5) are located in  the southeast corner and along the northern periphery of the study area. The  district name is a bit of a misnomer, as it allows for a range of residential  types from single family to multi-family apartment structures up to 60 feet (5  stories). Residential structures over 60 feet require a special permit.  However, because the majority of R5 zoning within the study area falls under  two overlays, the Washington Street District and Sagamore Hill Corridor  Overlay, allowed uses are very different than in a typical R5 areas. (Both  overlays are discussed below.) <br>
  </p>
<h4>Zoning Overlay  Districts<br>
</h4>
<p><span class="InlineHeadings">Residential Re-use Overlay District: </span>The Residential Re-use Overlay District, adopted in  2003, includes CBD zoned parcels within 1,500 ft of the Lynn Commuter Rail  station – which includes virtually all CBD parcels with a few exceptions along  the periphery. The overlay, which is buried in the zoning ordinance as a  footnote, provides the only mechanism for as of right residential development  in the CBD (up to 25 units as of right, more with a Special Permit). It also requires  retail and services (including restaurants as of right) to occupy at least 75 percent  of the ground floor in all redevelopment projects. The adoption of the  residential reuse district has been a success, and in many ways served as the  catalyst for reinvestment downtown - nearly all buildings with potential for  residential reuse have been converted bringing hundreds of new residents to  downtown. <br>
  </p>
<p><span class="InlineHeadings">Washington Street District and Sagamore Hill Corridor  Overlay: </span>The Washington Street District (WS) overlay and  Sagamore Hill Corridor Overlay (SHCO) district work to implement goals and  strategies set forth in the mixed-use Washington Street Gateway Plan (2008), which  is referred to directly in Section 16B Site Plan Review in the zoning code. (For  more on Washington Street Gateway Plan, click here.) The districts are mapped  adjacent to each other in the R5 district in the southeast corner of the study  area, and work to create a more vibrant mixed-use environment with a more  diverse and active mix along the Washington Street spine that transitions more  gradually to the residential-only district to the east.</p>
<p>The Washington Street District, adopted in 2010, includes all R5  parcels with frontage along Washington Street. (The district was recently  expanded to include some additional parcels as part of a development initiative by Lynn Housing Authority and Neighborhood Development.) The overlay allows for a wide range of residential and  commercial uses in the hopes of creating a mixed-use gateway into downtown. The  overlay limits as of right residential uses within the R5 district to higher  density row houses, apartment houses, and multi-family high rise developments.  Single family is not allowed. Significantly, the overlay also allows for  commercial uses typically found in downtown mixed-use environments, including  retail stores, eating and drinking establishments as of right (excluding  drive-throughs), general and professional offices, hotels, retail stores and  places of assembly and recreation.</p>
<p> The adjacent Sagamore Hill Corridor Overlay (SHCO) is the  transitional district between the WS overlay and the larger R5 district, and allows  for a more limited mix of commercial uses as of right compared to the WS  overlay, , including general offices, places of assembly for private recreation  (fitness centers), retail stores and custom workshops, but does not allow uses  like boarding houses or eating and drinking establishments. <br>
</p>
<h4>Special Permits and Site Plan Review<br>
</h4>
<p><span class="InlineHeadings">Special Permits: </span>As highlighted above, many uses typically found in  downtowns require a special permit within the study area including new  residential development and other uses identified in Section 4.4 and section  12.1. Uses requiring a special permit are approved or denied by the City  Council. Effects upon the local neighborhood and the city as a whole are  considered, and no project will be approved if the use would result in  &ldquo;substantial injury.&rdquo; Although the procedure itself is quite clear, review  criteria are vague which may deter potential investment, since clarity and  predictability are attractive to developers and business owners. <br>
  </p>
<p class="InlineHeadings">Special Permit Procedure</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proponent must submit a written  application to the City Clerk, who is also the City Council Clerk.</li>
  <li>City Council will issue a notice of  public hearing.</li>
  <li>City Council holds a public hearing and  renders a decision. Permit may be denied, accepted, or accepted with  conditions. </li>
  <li>If accepted, permit is good for 2 years.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="InlineHeadings">Site Plan Review: </span>In addition to the special permit process, one of  three separate site plan reviews may be required depending on the type of  development or the zoning district in which the project will be built. Although  the procedures are fairly clear, reviews appear to be subjective, and can take  90 days or longer (up to 160 in some instances), depending on receipt of  materials and on the approval process.</p>
<p> In the CBD, Section 16 requires a site plan review by  the Planning Department for all projects seeking a special permit that include  new construction, an enlargement of more than 500 gross square feet, or parking  and loading areas. Minimum requirements include a professional site plan showing  methods of egress and access, siting of existing and proposed buildings, total  gross floor area, height, and more; a water and sewer utilities plan; a  stormwater plan; a parking plan, etc. Additional materials, like traffic  impacts, may also be required.</p>
<p>Section 16B, Central Business District Site Plan  Review applies only to reuse projects within the Residential Reuse Overlay, and  is performed by the Lynn Central Square Site Plan Review Committee (SPRC) after  submission to the Office of Economic and Community Development. Review is more specific  than in Section 16, and requires from the applicant additional materials  including renderings of all facades of proposed buildings, location and type of  residential and commercial access, use of all abutting buildings,  location/materials/sizes of all signs, and more. Additionally, the SPRC may  hold as many meetings as necessary to review the proposal with the applicant  within a 35 day period, which can be extended by an additional 30 days if  needed.</p>
<p>Section 16B Waterfront Zone Site Plan Review, which  includes applicable projects within the WS and SCHO overlay districts, requires  the most extensive review, which can take up to a maximum 160 days. In addition  to requirement similar to those in 16B, the review also states that development  must be consistent with the City of Lynn Waterfront Master Plan.</p>
<h4>Parking</h4>
<p>  <span class="InlineHeadings">Parking requirements within the Lynn Zone Ordinance</span> are  uniform by use type no matter the location within the city. As a result,  downtown development projects require the same amount of parking as those in  more suburban locations. According to Section 9, Off-Street Parking  Requirements, every multi-family residential unit requires 1.5 spaces per unit  (excluding elderly units, which require 0.25 spaces per unit), retail and  office establishments require 3.5 spaces per 1,000 gross square feet, and  restaurants require 1 space for every 4 seats. These are quite high for a  downtown environment and could serve as an impediment, especially if expensive  structured parking is required to accommodate the number of spaces. They should  be revised to better reflect a walkable, transit-served urban environment.</p>
<p>In particular, the 1.5 spaces per multifamily unit is  high for studio or 1-bedroom units in a downtown where more residents are  likely to walk or take transit or are more likely to have one car per  household. The 3.5 spaces for every 1,000 gross sf of downtown retail is also  high, given that many customers likely live or work in the area, and will not  require a parking space. In fact, many municipalities do not require any  off-street parking for commercial uses in downtowns, rather they assume that  the community will accept this responsibility (street parking, municipal lots  and structures, of which there are many in downtown). Further, although office  parking requirements make sense in suburban areas where nearly all employees  will access jobs by automobile, they should be lowered in downtown where some  workers will likely arrive by transit (bus, commuter rail), and some will walk  or bike. Also, downtowns often present opportunities for shared parking since  adjacent uses (e.g. office and residential) often don&rsquo;t require parking at the  same time. Strategies for better use of underutilized parking (e.g. MBTA  garage) can also alleviate the need for more parking.</p></td>
