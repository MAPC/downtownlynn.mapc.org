<h3>Project Location &amp; Regional Context</h3>
<p><span class="InlineHeadings">The  City of Lynn</span> is a <a href="http://www.mapc.org/sites/default/files/Massachusetts_Community_Types_-_July_2008.pdf" target="_blank">regional urban center</a> home to about 90,000 residents at the  gateway between the North Shore and the urban core of Greater Boston. It is the  largest city on the Massachusetts North Shore,  the 4<sup>th</sup> largest city in  the MAPC region (after Boston, Cambridge, and Quincy), the 9<sup>th</sup>  largest in Massachusetts and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_population_in_New_England" target="_blank">16<sup>th</sup> largest in New England</a>.
</p>
<p><span class="InlineHeadings">Downtown  Lynn</span> is conveniently located along the <a href="http://www.mbta.com/" target="_blank">MBTA</a> Newburyport/Rockport Commuter Rail  Line, well-served by MBTA buses, and is in close proximity to Routes 1A, 129,  and 107. Downtown Lynn is nine miles from Logan International Airport and is  about 5 miles from Wonderland MBTA Station which connects to Blue Line subway  service. In the near future, Lynn is expected to be served by a commuter ferry  as well.</p>


<p><span class="InlineHeadings">Lynn is variously  characterized as a regional urban center, a gateway city, and a smaller  industrial city. </span>These cities often have in common a strong industrial past –  they were thriving in the late 19th or early 20th century  – which was followed by a decline in the mid-late 20th century as a  result of changing economic structures and housing preferences. They are also  often seen as places that have always been host to larger immigrant  populations, thanks in part to more affordable housing and commercial real  estate options. Today, these communities face challenges but also many  opportunities to become models for creative and inclusive revitalization.</p>
      <p>Typical  of a <a href="http://www.mapc.org/sites/default/files/Massachusetts_Community_Types_-_July_2008.pdf" target="_blank">regional urban  center</a>,  as defined by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, Lynn has an &ldquo;urban-scale  downtown core surrounded by more suburban residential neighborhoods.&rdquo;  Anecdotally, this is how some Downtown Lynn residents characterize Lynn as  well: as urban and suburban Lynn.  It has  experienced slow population growth in recent years, and population decline in  years past. </p>
      <p>Massachusetts  General Law <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter23A/Section3A" target="_blank">defines a Gateway City</a> as one that has a population between  35,000-250,000 residents, a median household income below the state average,  and a rate of educational attainment for a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher that is  below the state average. Review our analysis of Lynn's <a href="/What_We_Learned/Population_Characteristics.html">population characteristics</a> for more information. Lynn qualifies for <a href="http://www.mass.gov/hed/community/planning/gatweay.html" target="_blank">Gateway  City programs and initiatives</a> through the Massachusetts Executive Office of  Housing and Economic Development.</p>
      <p>The  <a href="https://www.bostonfed.org/commdev/conf/2011/smaller-industrial-cities/index.htm" target="_blank">Federal Reserve Bank of Boston</a>, <a href="http://www.policylink.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lkIXLbMNJrE&b=5136581&ct=6996875" target="_blank">PolicyLink</a>, and others have devoted research  initiatives to smaller industrial cities similar to Lynn – cities that have a  strong industrial past but now face economic, fiscal, and political challenges.</p>
      
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Downtown  Lynn is in the midst of a renaissance.</span> A community with a rich industrial past,  known particularly for shoe manufacturing, declined in the latter half of the 20th  century, when it saw decades of disinvestment, population decline, and a  deteriorating reputation. This trend has been steadily reversing. Since the  early 2000s, public and private investment has led to high-impact development  in Lynn, particularly in Downtown and along the Waterfront. Vacant industrial  buildings in Downtown have been converted into residential lofts. Downtown Lynn  has a burgeoning restaurant, arts, and theater scene, which will be bolstered  by the Downtown Lynn Cultural District established in 2011.      </p>
      <p><span class="InlineHeadings">This project focuses on Downtown Lynn.</span>  In order to define a geographic focus area  for this project, MAPC consulted with the City as well as reviewed the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lynnma.gov/cityhall_documents/isd/City%20of%20Lynn%20Zone%20Ordinance%20DEC%202010.pdf" target="_blank">Lynn  Zone Ordinance</a> and  <a href="http://lynnma.gov/cityhall_documents/maps/zoning_map/Lynn_Zoning_2011-01-18.pdf" target="_blank">zoning map</a> and recent land use plans including the <a href="http://www.cityoflynnoecd.net/community_gateway.shtml" target="_blank">Downtown/Market Street Vision Plan</a>, the <a href="http://www.cityoflynnoecd.net/community_waterfront.shtml" target="_blank">Lynn Waterfront Master Plan</a> and the <a href="http://www.cityoflynnoecd.net/community_sagamorehill.shtml" target="_blank">Washington Street Gateway District Plan</a>. </p>
      <p>While most people may not think of Downtown in terms of an exact boundary, MAPC defined two geographic areas for analysis purposes. The larger of the two areas, which we refer to as the &quot;greater Downtown and Waterfront study area,&quot; encompasses the entirety of the waterfront and downtown as defined in previous planning efforts, and is defined by the boundaries of 2010 <a href="http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_ct.html" target="_blank">Census Tracts</a>. </p>
      <p>The primary Downtown Study Area includes a more targeted area for which MAPC has provided detailed zoning recommendations, property analysis, and other strategies for improvement. This area includes the entire Central Business District (CBD) per the Lynn Zone  Ordinance, as well as the Residential Re-Use Overlay District, the Washington  Street Overlay Corridor (WS), and the Sagamore Hill Corridor Overlay District  (SHCO). A few adjacent blocks zoned Light Industrial (LI), Business (B), and  High Rise Building District (R5) are also included.</p></td>
