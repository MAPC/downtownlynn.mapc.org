The <a href="/Who_We_Met/Public_Forum.html">Open House and Public Forum</a> in May 2013 used this tagline as its theme and the photos below are snapshots from this event. (Photos below by James K.

	  <p><span class="InlineHeadings">Project mission:</span> This project will build upon the existing efforts to revitalize Downtown Lynn by providing geographic data, recommending land use and policy changes, and identifying funding and human capital resources that will lead to strategic, high impact reinvestment.</p>

The <a href="http://www.mapc.org/metrofuture/sustainable-communities" target="_blank">Metro Boston Sustainable Communities Consortium and Steering Committee</a> directed $85,000 of grant funds for this project in Downtown Lynn, which was matched with additional funding from MAPC. This is the largest single-municipality planning project under this grant program, and represents a significant investment of critical regional importance.</p>
